      When Superstorm Sandy hit the US East Coast in 2012, there were tens of thousands of people who became homeless overnight. It was one New York host on Airbnb who had a great idea. She wanted to volunteer her spare bedrooms and she didn’t want to get paid for it. We realized when she emailed us the idea, we didn’t have a system in place to allow volunteering of rooms for free. That’s what started a 24-hour engineering marathon to create that capability. What started as one woman’s idea, within days, became a movement of compassion and hospitality. 1,000 people offered their spare bedroom. Former Mayor Bloomberg held a press conference and highlighted this effort to quickly respond to people in need.

      We realized this wasn’t just confined to this one event. Inspired by our hosts’ generosity, we quickly developed a tool that made it easy for them to host people for free. That anywhere in the world where we have community, we can help people in need within hours. Since then, in more than 65 emergencies around the world, our community has opened their doors, and spare bedrooms, to those in desperate need of a safe harbor.

      Using our disaster relief tool, the Airbnb community has housed thousands of first responders and relief workers dispatched to disaster sites. Our hosts’ altruism helps these courageous men and women do life-saving work where it is most essential, from Florida, North Carolina and Haiti after Hurricane Matthew, to Louisiana after devastating flooding, to the wildfires in Fort McMurray, Canada.

      So for the last five years as great as the growth of our host community has been, we realized we could take it to a whole other level simply by shifting from being reactive to being proactive. No waiting around for the crisis to hit, but to anticipate and harness this natural generosity on a daily basis.
