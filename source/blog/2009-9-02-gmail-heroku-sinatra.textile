title: Heroku + Sinatra + Gmail
---
p. A friend asked me recently if I could build him a super simple web app that could email him. I said 'SUuuuuuurrre' that'll be easy I'll throw it on heroku and it will be awesome! I forgot using gmail is incredibly annoying. Took me way too long to figure out the problem. It's that same Net::SMTP error that's been hacked around a ton of times. I copied one such hack and added in Pony:

p. pony_gmail.rb -> "http://gist.github.com/179967":http://gist.github.com/179967

p. Now in a post(probably) add a pony line that's configured to use smtp:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/179978.js"></script>

p. The only thing left is to add pony to your .gems file and you are ready to email people from Sinatra on Heroku using gmail!!

<script src="http://gist.github.com/180382.js"></script>

I created a fun app to annoy one of my coworkers. If you'd like to send my coworker and email (to all his addresses) click the link below!
