title: iPhone Simulator (IndigoDevice) Internal Error
---

If you ever get the following error:

"Internal Error
File:	/SourceCache/IndigoDebuggingPlugin/IndigoDebuggingPlugin-31/IndigoDevice/XCiPhoneSimulatorDevice.m
Line:	265
Object:	<XCiPhoneSimulatorDevice:0x027cf3d0>
Method:	_launchSimulatedExecutable:

Assertion failed: nil == _currentSimulatorSession"

I'll save you about 2 hours of your time. There are some complicated solutions to this problem ("here":http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8376375). But all you need to do is, quit xcode/iphone simulator, go into your (username)/Library/Application Support/ and delete the iPhone Simulator folder. Restart xcode and build your app. Worked for me. So pissed that wasted 2 hours of my life.
