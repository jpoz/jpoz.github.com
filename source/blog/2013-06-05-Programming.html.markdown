title: Programming isn't an identity

I don't know how many times I've been told "You don't seem like a programmer". I also don't know if it's a complement or an insult. Ruling on the positive, I usually reply something along the lines of "Uh Thanks?". Not really sure why I hear this so much. I love programming. I've been a professional programmer for the last 6 years of my life. 

I haven't always programmed. I graduated undergrad with a degree in economics. After college I jumped into the Market Research industry. To make a long story short: I learned to program because my job was repetitious and it drove me crazy. So much so I wrote a program to do it for me! Yup I learned to program because I'm lazy. So maybe I "don't seem like a progrmmer" because I didn't start my professional career as one? I'm not sure.

To be fair I don't think I am a programmer either. I mean, I get paid to program. But if all I was paid to do was optimize algoruthums or make up specifications I'd go crazy. I write code to solve problems. Real problems. Problems real people have.
