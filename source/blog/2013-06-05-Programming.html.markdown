I don't know how many times I've been told "You don't seem like a programmer". I also don't know if it's a complement or an insult. Ruling on the positive, I usually reply something along the lines of "Uh Thanks?". Not really sure why I hear this so much. I love programming. I've been a paid to programming for the last 6 years of my life. 

I haven't always programmed. I graduated undergrad with a degree in economics and no idea what I wanted to do with my life. To make a long story short: I learned to program because I hated the job I got right out of college. So much so I wrote a program to do it for me! Yup I learned to program because I'm lazy. So maybe I "don't seem like a progrmmer" because I didn't start my professional career as one? I'm not sure.

To be fair I don't think I am a programmer either. I mean, I get paid to program. But if all I was paid to do was optimize algoruthums or make up specifications I'd go crazy. I write code to solve problems. Real problems. Problems real people have.

## Programming isn't my career. It's just the tool set I'm best at.

If I was a better writer than I was coder, I would write. If I was better at statistics I would use statistics.
