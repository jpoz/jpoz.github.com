title: Almaz - A rack middleware that logs to Redis
---

h1. Almaz

p. You know what really grinds my gears: looking through log files. Especially when you have 3 slices running all having their own separate logs! Grrrrr. Introducing Almaz!

p. "http://github.com/jpoz/almaz":http://github.com/jpoz/almaz

p. An exact copy of the 1960s Soviet Union spy satellite, written in Ruby! Almaz has two parts: Almaz::Capture and Almaz::View.

Almaz::Capture:

# Counts all requests going to your server.
# Records the URL.
# Records the params.

Almaz::View:

# Show you the statistics.
# Provides basic authentication.

p. All the data is stored in Redis! And all the code for Almaz is in one file (including the view to show the statistics). 

h2. Example:

p. Here's a super basic Sinatra app. "Almaz":http://github.com/jpoz/almaz/blob/master/almaz.rb has been copied into the app's directory 

<script src="http://gist.github.com/232169.js"></script>

h2. Usage:

p. Let your users run wild. Almaz will be watching everything, even request that you don't have a route for. Then go to yoursite.com/stats, type in your username and password and you can see all the stats for your site.

h3. Notes:

p. This has not been performance tested or scaled up in any means. So don't use it in production... yet :-)
