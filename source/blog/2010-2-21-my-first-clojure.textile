title: My first Clojure
---

p. My first attempt at Clojure went pretty well. Not really sure if it's "good" Clojure, but I'm very happy it works. :-)

p. The first problem I set out for myself with Clojure was to calculate a simple liner regression (OLS). I wanted to find the relationship between 2 sets of numbers. The output being a y = mx+b equation. Clojure needed to calculate m (the beta) and b (the y intercept). Below is what I came up with. Two equations: olsbeta and yintercept with 2 utility functions sum and multsum.

p. Which returns: <code>y = 61.272186542107434*x + -39.06195591883866</code>
