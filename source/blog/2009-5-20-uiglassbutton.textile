title: UIGlassButton Example
---

UIGlassButtons are awesome. To bad Apple doesn't want us to know about them. They're slick buttons that inherit from the UIButton class. You use it pretty much the same way you'd use a UIButton, but since Apple hasn't included it in any header files you'll have to declare the class yourself. Below is a short example of how to create a UIGlassButton. Enjoy!

Some discussion:

The only warning I should put on this class is that some have said using the class will make sure that your app won't make it through the review process. I don't know if that's true or not, but if my app makes it through I'll update this post.
