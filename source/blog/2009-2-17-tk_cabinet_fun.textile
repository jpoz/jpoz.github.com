title: Tokyo Cabinet and Rack fun!
---

p(date). 17 Feb 2009

I started playing around with Tokyo Cabinet and Rufus-Tokyo tonight. I have to say I was pretty impressed. Tokyo Cabinet (with the help of rufus-tokyo) is so dead easy to use. It took me about an hour to install, learn and get a dead simple rack app up and running.

I made a quick and dirty logger:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rubygems'  
require 'rack'  
require 'rufus/tokyo'  
  
class Logger  
  
  def initialize(t)  
    @t = t  
  end  
  
  def call(env)  
    @t[Time.now.to_i.to_s] = { 'time' => Time.now.to_i.to_s, 'info' => env.inspect }  
    array = @t.query { |q|  
      q.order_by 'time'  
    }  
    output = "The data:"  
    array.each { |d| output << "<br/>#{d.inspect}" }  
    [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, output]  
  end  
  
end  
  
rackApp = Rack::Builder.new do  
  
  map '/' do  
    run Logger.new(Rufus::Tokyo::Table.new('visitors.tdb'))  
  end  
  
end  
  
Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run rackApp, :Port => 9292
{% endhighlight %}
