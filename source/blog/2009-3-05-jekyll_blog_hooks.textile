title: 'Git post commit hooks with Jekyll'
---

Creating a Jekyll blog is both fun and easy. I was amazed how easy it was to get started and get something up and running in a couple minutes!

If you don't already have a Jekyll blog you can get started here: "github.com/mojombo/jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master

After I got something I was happy with, I wanted to make it super easy to deploy my blog. I created a post commit hook so every time I commit my blog it would publish it up to my site.

Adding the following lines of code to .git/hooks/post-commit and making the file executable did the trick!

{% highlight bash %}
echo "--- Creating site ---"
jekyll --pygments
echo "--- Uploading site ---"
scp -r _site/* (username)@(example.com):directory/
{% endhighlight %}
