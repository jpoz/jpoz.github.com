      <p>I don't know how many times I've been told "You don't seem like a programmer".
I also don't know if it's a complement or an insult. Ruling on the positive, I
usually reply something along the lines of "Uh Thanks?". Thinking they're
probably commenting on the fact I don't look like one of the characters from
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/">Revenge of the Nerds</a> (which happens to
be one of my favorite movies growing up). Not really sure why I hear this so
much. I love programming. I've been a professional programmer for the last 6
years of my life.</p>

<p>I get the same comments from my fellow programmers but in a different ways. One
of my good friends and coworkers after years of us working together in multiple
companies confided in me: "When I met you for the first time I thought you were
a douche bag. You just look like a frat bro dude."</p>

<p>I haven't always programmed. I graduated undergrad with a degree in economics.
After college I jumped into the Market Research industry. To make a long story
short: I learned to program because my job was repetitious and it drove me crazy.
So much so I wrote a program to do it for me! Yup I learned to program because
I'm lazy. So maybe I "don't seem like a progrmmer" because I didn't start my
professional career as one? I'm not sure.</p>

<p>To be fair I don't think I am a programmer either. I mean, I get paid to write
software. But if all I was paid to do was optimize algorithms or make up
specifications I'd go crazy. I write code to solve problems. Real problems.
Problems real people have. Programming is less my career, more how I get my job
done. Right now "I work in finance". I work for <a href="https://www.simple.com">Simple</a>.
In the last couple years I've worked with: advertising, healthcare, sports,
entertainment, I guess I even worked for the government for awhile there. I
think that's the best part about programming. You get to jump around. You're
not stuck in one industry.</p>

<h2 id="second-draft">Second Draft</h2>

<p>Last weekend I attended an out of town wedding. It was great. I met some great
people and celebrated two of my good friends new life together. Making the rounds
at the reception I often got asked: What do you do up in Oregon? And I would
respond: I'm a programmer for a software startup. Responses varied from interest
to confusion. But one main thread I found was the note "You don't seem like a
programmer".</p>

<p>I don't know how many times I've been told "You don't seem like a programmer".
I also don't know if it's a complement or an insult. Ruling on the positive, I
usually reply something along the lines of "Uh Thanks?". Thinking they're
probably commenting on the fact I don't look like one of the characters from
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/">Revenge of the Nerds</a> (which happens to
be one of my favorite movies growing up). Or maybe it's because in a normal
coarse of chatting with me I rarely find myself directly talking about technology.
I'm not totally sure why I hear this so much. But for some reason it rubs me
the wrong way. As if only people that have certain attributes can be certain
types of professionals.</p>

<p>I love programming. I've been a professional programmer for the last 6 years of
my life. I kind of fell into programming. It was anything I set out to do
professionally. I graduated undergrad with a degree in economics.
After college I jumped into the Market Research industry. It was boring and to
make a long story short: I learned to program because my job was so repetitious
it drove me crazy. It was so repetitious I wrote a program to do it for me!
Yup I learned to program because I'm lazy. So maybe I "don't seem like a programmer"
because I didn't start my professional career as one? I'm not sure.</p>
